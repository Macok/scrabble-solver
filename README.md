# Scrabble-Solver

This is an implementation of a Scrabble Solver originally described in this paper by Andrew Appel and Guy Jacobsen: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf

Currently it isn't really playable as an opponent, it just plays against itself and can create an arbitrary number of valid scrabble games. The end goal of this project is to be able to take a picture of a real scrabble game and have the algorithm return the best possible move that can be made given the board state and set of tiles in the player's hand.
