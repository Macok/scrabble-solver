# Scrabble-Solver

This is an implementation of a Scrabble Solver originally described in this paper by Andrew Appel and Guy Jacobsen: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf

Currently it isn't really playable as an opponent, it just plays against itself and can create an arbitrary number of valid scrabble games.
